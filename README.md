# LandingPageProject
A mock landing page, as part of the Odin Project curriculum.  I'm excited!

Reflection: This was an exciteing project, it was my first time building an entire 
webpage from scratch.  At least one of this complexity.  Though it was challenging,
in the end it was pretty invigorating to encounter many problems, and then figure out 
a solution to them.  I definitely learned a lot from this and look forward to learning a lot more.
